When you have a user account, go to the [Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) page at the Spotify Developer website and, if necessary, log in. Accept the latest [Developer Terms of Service](https://developer.spotify.com/terms) to complete your account set up.

**4. Register this application**

The next step is to register this application following [these steps](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/).

**5. Provide credentials**

The last step is to provide the necessary `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` variables in the generated `env.local` file.

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```
